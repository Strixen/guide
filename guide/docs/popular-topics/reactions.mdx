# Reactions

Reactions are Discord's way of adding emojis to other messages. Early on, before Discord introduced [components](../interactions/buttons.mdx), this system was largely used to make interactive messages and apps.
Having bots react to messages is less common now, and is somewhat considered legacy behavior.  
This guide will teach you the basics of how they work, since they still have their use cases, like reaction role systems and polling.

In Disnake, reactions are represented with <DocsLink reference="disnake.Reaction">Reaction</DocsLink> objects. Whenever you operate on a <DocsLink reference="disnake.Message">Message</DocsLink> you can access a list of reactions attached to that message.
In this guide we will be providing an example using the <DocsLink reference="disnake.on_raw_reaction_add">on_raw_reaction_add / remove</DocsLink> events and a <DocsLink ext="commands" reference="disnake.ext.commands.Bot.message_command">message_command</DocsLink>'s <DocsLink reference="disnake.MessageCommandInteraction">interaction</DocsLink> to demonstrate.

-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Reactions.users">disnake.Reactions.users</DocsLink> won't be covered here since the docs
    demonstrate its use elegantly.

:::info
**Reaction limitations**

-   To maintain a consistent reaction cache, <DocsLink reference="disnake.Intents.reactions">Intents.reactions</DocsLink> is recommended to manipulate others' reactions, and is required if you intend to utilize events.
-   A message can have a maximum of 20 unique reactions on it at one time.
-   Reactions are inherently linked to emojis, and your bot will not have access to resend all emojis used by Discord users. ( The bot can always react to others reactions )
-   Dealing with reactions results in a fair amount of extra API calls, meaning it can have rate-limit implications on deployment scale.
-   Using Reactions for user interfaces was never intended behavior, and is ultimately inferior to the newer component interface.

### Emojis

Since reactions utilize Emojis this guide will also include a quick primer on how disnake handles emojis  
**Emojis have three forms:**

-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.Emoji">Emoji</DocsLink> Custom emojis are primarily returned when custom emojis are grabbed
    from the guild/bot
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.PartialEmoji">PartialEmoji</DocsLink> Stripped down version of Emoji. Which appears in raw
    events or when the bot cannot access the custom emoji
-   [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html) Strings: are normally returned when unicode emojis are used. These are the standard emojis most are familiar with (‚úÖüéÆüíõüí´)
    but these will also come as a PartialEmoji in raw events

There is also a small write up about this [here](../faq/general.mdx#how-can-i-add-a-reaction-to-a-message).

:::note
The examples are only meant to demonstrate how disnake interacts with reactions, and should probably not be copied verbatim.  
These examples are not intended for [cogs](../getting-started/using-cogs.mdx), but can easily be adapted to run inside them.  
Some examples are also available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake/tree/master/examples).

### Example using on_reaction events

There are a few reaction related [events](https://docs.disnake.dev/en/stable/api.html#event-reference) we can listen/subscribe to:

-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.on_raw_reaction_add">on_raw_reaction_add</DocsLink>, called when a user adds a reaction
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.on_raw_reaction_remove">on_raw_reaction_remove</DocsLink>, called when a user's
    reaction is removed
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.on_raw_reaction_clear">on_raw_reaction_clear</DocsLink>, called when a message has all
    reactions removed
-   <DocsLink reference="disnake.on_raw_reaction_clear_emoji">on_raw_reaction_clear_emoji</DocsLink>, called when all
    reactions with a specific emoji are removed from a message

There are non-raw equivalents, but they rely on the cache. If the message is not found in the internal cache, then the event is not called.  
For this reason raw events are preferred, and you are only giving up on an included User/Member object that you can easily fetch if you need it.

One important thing about raw_reaction events is that all the payloads are only populated with <DocsLink reference="disnake.PartialEmoji">PartialEmojis</DocsLink>  
This is generally not an issue since it contains everything we need, but its something you should be aware of.  
Raw reaction add/remove events come as <DocsLink reference="disnake.RawReactionActionEvent">RawReactionActionEvent</DocsLink> which is called `payload` in the examples.  
The raw clearing events each have their own event payloads.

```python title="on_raw_reaction_add.py"
@bot.listen()
async def on_raw_reaction_add(self, payload: disnake.RawReactionActionEvent):
    # For this example we will have the bot post a message describing the event, and adding the emoji to that message as an exercise

    # We don't want the bot to react to its own actions, nor DM's in this case
    if payload.user_id == bot.user.id:
        return
    if not payload.guild_id:
        return  # guild_id is None if its a DM

    # Raw events contain the channel ID, so we need to grab the channel from the cache
    event_channel = bot.get_channel(payload.channel_id)

    # With the channel in hand we can use it to post a new message like normal, Messageable.send() returns the message, and we need to store it
    event_response_message = await event_channel.send(
        content=f"Reaction {payload.emoji} added by: {payload.member.display_name}!"
    )

    # Now, we could add our own reaction to the message we just sent.
    # One thing we need to consider is that the bot cannot access custom emojis from servers they're not members of (see caution below),
    # because of this we need to check if we have access to the custom_emoji.
    # disnake.Emoji has a `is_usable()` function we could reference, but partials do not, so we need to check manually.
    if payload.emoji.is_custom_emoji() and not bot.get_emoji(payload.emoji.id):
        return  # The emoji is custom, but from a guild the bot cannot access.
    await event_response_message.add_reaction(payload.emoji)
```

Below is how the the listener above would react both for a unicode emoji and a custom emoji the bot can't access.  
Notice how second emoji resolved into **:disnake:** because the emoji is on a server not accessible to the bot:

<br />

:::caution
We can only use custom emojis from servers the bot has joined, but we can use them interchangeably on those servers.  
Bots can make <DocsLink reference="disnake.ui.Button">buttons</DocsLink> using emojis from servers they're not members of, this may or may not be intended behavior by Discord and should not be relied on.

**Here are a few examples on how reactions can be implemented:**

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="deny_reactions.py" label="Deny a role using reactions">

```python
# Members with a restricted role are only allowed to react with üíô

allowed_emojis = ["üíô"]
restricted_role_ids = [951263965235773480, 1060778008039919616]


@bot.listen()
async def on_raw_reaction_add(payload: disnake.RawReactionActionEvent):
    if payload.user_id == bot.user.id:
        return
    if not payload.guild_id:
        return  # guild_id is None if its a DM

    # From the docs we know that str(PartialEmoji) returns either the codepoint or <:emoji:id>
    if (
        any(payload.member.get_role(role) for role in restricted_role_ids)
        and str(payload.emoji) not in allowed_emojis
    ):
        # Getting the channel, and fetching message as these will be useful
        event_channel = bot.get_channel(payload.channel_id)
        event_message = await event_channel.fetch_message(payload.message_id)

        await event_message.remove_reaction(emoji=payload.emoji, member=payload.member)
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="main2.py" label="Simple reaction button">

```python

# This can be useful if you want the functionality of buttons, but want a more compact look.

button_emojis = ["‚úÖ"]  # What emojis to react to
reaction_messages = [1060797825417478154]  # What messages to monitor


@bot.listen()
async def on_raw_reaction_add(payload: disnake.RawReactionActionEvent):
    if payload.user_id == bot.user.id:
        return
    if payload.message_id not in reaction_messages or str(payload.emoji) not in button_emojis:
        return

    # Getting the channel, and fetching message as these will be useful
    event_channel = bot.get_channel(payload.channel_id)
    event_message = await event_channel.fetch_message(payload.message_id)

    # Remove the reaction
    await event_message.remove_reaction(emoji=payload.emoji, member=payload.member)
    awesome_function()  # Do some stuff

    # Short message to let the user know it went ok. This is not an interaction so a message response is not strictly needed
    await event_channel.send("Done!", delete_after=10.0)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="reaction_role.py" label="Simple reaction roles">

```python
# A very simple reaction role system

### Example using an ApplicationCommandInteraction

Using a `message_command` here because the message object is always included in the message commands interaction instance.  
This example is purely to demonstrate using the Reaction object since events deal with a similar but different class

```python title="message_command.py"
@commands.message_command()
async def list_reactions(self, inter: disnake.MessageCommandInteraction):

    response_string = ""  # Start with an empty string
    reaction_list = inter.target.reactions  # First we get the list of disnake.Reaction objects
    for index, reaction in enumerate(
        reaction_list
    ):  # We then loop through the reactions and use enumerate for indexing
        response_string += f"{index+1}. {reaction.emoji} - {reaction.count}\n"  # Using f-strings we format the list how we like

    # If the message has no reactions, response_string will be "" which evaluates to False
    await inter.response.send_message(response_string or "No Reactions found")

    # As with the previous examples, we can add reactions too

    # inter.response.send_message() does not return the message generated so we have to fetch it, thankfully we have this alias we can use
    message = await inter.original_response()

    for reaction in reaction_list:

        # Since the reactions are present on the message, the bot can react to it, even though it does not have access to the custom emoji
        await inter.target.add_reaction(reaction)

        # However we still cannot add new reactions we don't have access to.
        # PartialEmojis are generated if the bot does not have access to it, so we can filter on that to skip them
        if isinstance(reaction.emoji, disnake.PartialEmoji):
            continue
        await message.add_reaction(reaction)
```
